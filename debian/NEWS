akonadi (1.3.1-3+squeeze1) stable-proposed-updates; urgency=low

  The location of the socket used to communicate with the Akonadi server was
  changed to better support home directories on network file systems. After
  updating to this version, applications making use of Akonadi will only
  work correctly after restarting both the Akonadi server and client
  applications.
